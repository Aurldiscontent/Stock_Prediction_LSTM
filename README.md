# STOCK PRICE PREDICTION USING LSTM(LONG SHORT TERM MEMORY)
The Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM project focuses on forecasting Netflix's stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a powerful deep learning technique for sequential data. Stock market prices are highly volatile and influenced by numerous factors, making traditional models less effective in capturing long-term dependencies. LSTMs, designed to handle time series data efficiently, were utilized to analyze historical stock price trends and predict future values. The dataset underwent preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, scaling data, and creating time-based sequences to ensure the model could effectively learn patterns.

The LSTM model was trained on past stock price data, and its performance was evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). To enhance accuracy, techniques like hyperparameter tuning, dropout regularization, and multiple LSTM layers were applied. The results demonstrated how deep learning models can capture complex patterns in financial data, making them useful for predicting stock trends. While LSTMs improve forecasting accuracy, the project also highlighted the limitations of predicting stock prices, given market uncertainties and external factors. This study provided hands-on experience with time series forecasting and showcased the potential of LSTMs in financial analytics.
